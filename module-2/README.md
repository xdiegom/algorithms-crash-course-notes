## **Module 2**

### **Math algorithms**

#### **Fibonacci Algorithm**

"_Is a sequence of infinite numbers where every other element is the sum of its two precending elements._"

#### **ðŸ’­ Problem**

Return the N+th element of the Fibonacci Sequence. E.g:

- fib(4) yields 5

The algorithm needs to do **two things**:

1. Calculate the sequence up to the element we're looking for.
2. Return that element.

#### **Prime Algorithm**

"_Is a sequence of infinite numbers where every other element is the sum of its two precending elements._"

#### **ðŸ’­ Problem**

Determine whether an input number is a prime number

- isPrime(9) // false
- isPrime(5) // true

A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and by itself.

The algorithm needs to do **one thing**:

1. Try dividing the number by all smaller numbers and return true if it's only divisible by itself and 1
